Mandatory capabilities in iOS for Sequential execution

Just to create a session with mobile
1. platformName --> iOS
2. automationName --> XCUITest
3. deviceName --> Anything of your choice (optional but recommended to identify the simulator)
4. udid --> Unique Device IDentifier of the specific device (optional but recommended to specify the exact device to test)
5. xcodeOrgId --> Team Id of the developer (can be identified from Certificate or got from Developer --> Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)
6. xcodeSigningId --> iPhone Developer (Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)

Create a session with mobile and install & run the app that I provide
1. platformName --> iOS
2. automationName --> XCUITest
3. app --> Entire path of the ipa/app file
4. deviceName --> Anything of your choice (optional but recommended to identify the simulator)
5. udid --> Unique Device IDentifier of the specific device (optional but recommended to specify the exact device to test)
6. xcodeOrgId --> Team Id of the developer (can be identified from Certificate or got from Developer --> Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)
7. xcodeSigningId --> iPhone Developer (Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)

Create a session with mobile and run the app that is already installed
1. platformName --> iOS
2. automationName --> XCUITest
3. bundleId --> Bundle Identifier of the app that needs to be launched (usually provided by developer)
4. deviceName --> Anything of your choice (optional but recommended to identify the simulator)
5. udid --> Unique Device IDentifier of the specific device (optional but recommended to specify the exact device to test)
6. app --> Entire path of the ipa/app file (optional if available)
7. xcodeOrgId --> Team Id of the developer (can be identified from Certificate or got from Developer --> Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)
8. xcodeSigningId --> iPhone Developer (Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)

Just to create a session with mobile and launch safari browser
1. platformName --> iOS
2. automationName --> XCUITest
3. browserName --> Safari
4. deviceName --> Anything of your choice (optional but recommended to identify the simulator)
5. udid --> Unique Device IDentifier of the specific device (optional but recommended to specify the exact device to test)
6. xcodeOrgId --> Team Id of the developer (can be identified from Certificate or got from Developer --> Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)

5. webkitDebugProxyPort --> mandatory only if my app is a hybrid/Mobile web app
6. mjpegServerPort --> mandatory only if there is a screenshot or video captured during the session
7. udid --> Unique Device IDentifier of the specific device (optional but recommended to specify the exact device to test)
8. xcodeOrgId --> Team Id of the developer (can be identified from Certificate or got from Developer --> Recommended if the WDA and App developer are different)
